# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Music Mirror aims to streamline the process of moving playlists from one platform to another. In order to to this, it is important that the user's interactions with the app are more efficient and effective than the alternative. Thus, this phase of our project was spent digging into the the layout and gathering feedback on the user experience.

## Methods

The Research methods we utilized were cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback. 

The purpose of a cognitive research method is to examine the learnability and perception of our wireframe design through users. Our UX team gathered three amateur UX researchers to walk through accomplishing a task based on scenarios.  At each step, we asked the UX researcher “Will the user know what to do at this step?” and “If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?”. The insights provided by the UX researchers could then be analyzed to find any steps of our design that need improvement. 

For informal feedback, the software engineers asked questions to receive feedback on Music Mirror.  Questions are as follows:
* What services would you use on this platform?
* What functions of the final product would you use the most?

The purpose of the questions is to see how we can broaden our user demographic and cater our product to our users.


## Findings

In our findings from our first research method of cognitive walkthroughs, we found that users often were confused about what would happen after the user logged in and used the services for the first time. through the cognitive walkthrough we learned that without a visual cue or conformation, the user would be confused about if the log-in attempt was successful as well as if the tabs that corresponded with the streaming services showed conformation of songs being transferred from one service to the next. Other insights provided by the UX researchers also led us to find that users would often be confused about signing into different services since there was no official sign-in page wireframe. These findings have led us to revise and add in additional pages that give the user a visual cue that their actions have been properly completed. 

For our informal feedback, We worked with the software engineers to ask important questions about the users and their overall use of the platform as a whole. The most important questions we found had to deal with what types of platforms would the users transfer music to and from as well as what functions were the most important and which were not. These two questions gave us the insight to analyze our main demographics, as well as the importance of making our platform simple enough to where most users would be able to use it without lots of prior knowledge. 

## Conclusions

Based on the reports gathered from the cognitive walkthrough, we found that users often were unsure if their actions actually resulted in the successful creation of a playlist, as well as confusion regarding the behavior of the sign-in buttons. Taking into account these new insights, we focused our attention on providing proper UI feedback to the user whenever they carried out actions.

The informal feedback gathered from the product demo gave the team more direction on where to move next, as certain proposed features and functions were more popular and sought after than others.

## Caveats

Caveats revolving around cognitive walkthroughs include low-fidelity design and no real user data. 

Using wireframes as our design does not provide real feedback on the actions given by the user. The user provides an assumption of a step toward the given goal but is ultimately redirected to the correct step based on the next piece of the wireframe. Given it is a low-fidelity design, this could impact the results of the UX researcher's interactions with the design.

Lastly, our cognitive walkthroughs were not done by actual users. We had UX researchers simulate what potential user behavior would be when attempting to accomplish a task. This can impact our results by reducing the accuracy of user behavior.
