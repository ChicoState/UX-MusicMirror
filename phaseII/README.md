# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

The Research methods we utilized were cognitive walkthroughs and informal feedback. 

The purpose of a cognitive research method is to examine the learnability and perception of our wireframe design through users. Our UX team gathered three amateur UX researchers to walk through accomplishing a task based on scenarios.  At each step, we asked the UX researcher “Will the user know what to do at this step?” and “If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?”. The insights provided by the UX researchers could then be analyzed to find any steps of our design that need improvement. 

After a demonstration of our design from the software engineers we had them ask questions to receive feedback on Music Mirror.  Questions are as follows:
* What services would you use on this platform?
* What functions of the final product would you use the most?
The purpose of the questions is to see how we can broaden our user demographic and cater our product to our users.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

Caveats revolving around cognitive walkthroughs include low-fidelity design and no real user data. 

Using wireframes as our design does not provide real feedback on the actions given by the user. The user provides an assumption of a step toward the given goal but is ultimately redirected to the correct step based on the next piece of the wireframe. Given it is a low-fidelity design, this could impact the results of the UX researcher's interactions with the design.

Lastly, our cognitive walkthroughs were not done by actual users. We had UX researchers simulate what potential user behavior would be when attempting to accomplish a task. This can impact our results by reducing the accuracy of user behavior.
