# Music Mirror

In the world of music streaming, there are a number of different platforms and services, all with different catalogs of available tracks, albums, and artists. This can make it excessively difficult to share music with others when there is a mismatch in which platforms they use. MusicMirror aims to solve this issue by providing a single app on a single page through which users can share, save, and transfer playlists with ease.
