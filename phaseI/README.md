# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

When people listen to music they like to create personalized playlists for different moods and different music. We believe that there should be software that can transfer all the songs from your playlists from one platform to another platform. By using our product Music Mirror a person can easily re-create the playlist they had on one streaming platform and transfer it to another seamlessly.
## Methods

 The research methods we utilized were competitive analysis, personas and scenarios, and heuristic analysis to discover new insights.

 The purpose of competitive analysis is to find the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors in the space of music transfer services. To find the competitors we wanted to analyze, we googled music transfer services and picked the top 3.  We gathered the main strengths and weaknesses along with the quality level, price of service, and the platforms of their application. 

 Our second research method was personas and scenarios to understand our demographic and targeted audience better. We described what the needs of certain users would be and formulated a background that represents real users. Our team then developed scenarios based on user needs. These insights created a focus on user-centered design in the scope of our application.

 We conducted a heuristic evaluation on one of our competitors to evaluate the principles of interaction design. Heuristic evaluation is valuable in the context of following best practices in design. As well as finding ways to improve user experience in our own design by doing better in certain heuristics compared to our competitors. The heuristic evaluation principles we used were Jacob Nielsenâ€™s 10 usability heuristics.

Nielsen 10 usability heuristics:
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and real-world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation

 For each heuristic, we gave a score(1-10), and a description. The score is based on how well the competitors follow the heuristics. The description provides the reasoning behind the score and possible recommendations for improving the heuristic scores.

 Competitive analysis, personas and scenarios, and heuristic evaluations were valuable in identifying weaknesses with other competitors and identifying user needs. As well as providing useful insights into leveraging an improved design compared to our competitors.



## Findings

In our first research method of competitive analysis, we started by looking at our competitors' products and evaluating their features and the UX. From our competitive analysis, we found that most of our competitors used similar pricing models as well as using their products as well. For example all 3 of our competitors which were song Shift, sound dizz, and tune my music all use a subscription-based model and limited songs to transfer for free. Through our research, we found that users would only be as inclined to use our competitors' products if the UI was simple and there was an option for free conversion from platform to platform. 

Our second research method of persona and scenarios went in-depth on the demographic of people using our product Music Mirror. In our research, we found that our demographic finds most competitors' products hard to use and very tedious to convert their playlists from platform to platform. From young adults to older adults who may not be as tech-savvy, we found that by simplifying the process a wider range of demographics would use our product 

Our third research method was our heuristic evaluations. Through these 10 evaluations of our competitors, we found that most of our competitors lacked in areas pertaining to the overall aesthetic of the UI as well and they found it difficult to use the product by signing up for their streaming services as well as logging into our own service. We also found that the buttons and colors of our competitors' services proved to be confusing from time to time due to all the conflicting colors and functions around the site. 

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

 The limitations have to be considered to assess the validity of our research. This is our team's first experience with these research methods in a UX setting. As we did our best to make meaningful insights, there could be potential oversights and or misguided findings. 

 Our team had to depend on personas and scenarios in a made-up setting to determine user needs. Therefore, we had no actual user data for our conclusions. Much of our data was based on the assumptions of our users with no actual user data to back up our findings. We did our best to predict user behavior but ultimately they were composed of assumptions.

 When finding competitors we did not have data to support the top competitors. We relied on a Google search assuming that the most popular music transfer services would result at the top. As that seems to be the trend with Google searches, there could be some ambiguity in our search for popular music transfer services.

 During the heuristic evaluation, the main caveat would be that some of the features of the competitor's service were premium features. Due to limited resources, our team was not able to evaluate the competitor in a detailed manner.
